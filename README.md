# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code challenges for the years 2021 and 2022. The Advent of Code is an annual event where participants solve programming puzzles and challenges for each day in December leading up to Christmas. I use these challenges as an opportunity to stay sharp in programming, algorithms, and technology.

You can find more information about the Advent of Code challenges and participate in the challenges yourself at [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/). Each day in December, a new challenge is released and participants can earn points by solving the challenge correctly. The challenges vary in difficulty, and often require creative problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

You can find my solutions for the 2021 and 2022 Advent of Code challenges in their respective folders in this repository. Each folder contains the solutions for each day's challenge, along with input files and any additional code used to solve the challenges.
